        <div class="definition-heading">How do Stocks work?</div>
        <p>
            A stock is a financial instrument that represents ownership in a company or corporation and a proportionate claim on its assets and earnings.
            Stocks are also called shares or equity Owning stock means that a shareholder owns a slice of the company equal to the number of shares held 
            as a proportion of the company’s total outstanding shares.</p>

        <p> For example, an individual or entity that owns 100,000 shares of a company with one million outstanding shares would have a 10% ownership stake 
            in it.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">How does Stock Market Work?</div>
        <p>
            The stock market provides a venue where companies raise capital by selling shares of stock, or equity, to investors. Stocks give shareholders voting 
            rights as well as a residual claim on corporate earnings in the form of capital gains and dividends.Individual and institutional investors come 
            together on stock exchanges to buy and sell shares in a public market. When you buy a share of stock on the stock market, you are not buying it from the company; you are buying it from an existing shareholder.

        <div class="definition-heading">What happen's when you sell a Stock?:</div>
        <p>
            You do not sell your shares back to the company; instead, you sell them to another investor on the exchange.

        <h3>How to Invest in Stocks?</h3>
        <div class="definition-heading">Step 1:Set Clear Investment Goals</div>
        
        <p>
            Begin by specifying your financial objectives. Clear goals will guide your investment decisions and help you stay 
            focused. Consider both short-term and long-term goals, as they will affect your investment strategy.You might have 
            short-term goals like saving for a home or a vacation or have long-term objectives like securing a comfortable 
            retirement or funding a child’s education. Your objectives depend on your life stage and ambitions. Younger 
            investors tend to focus more on growth and long-term wealth accumulation, while those closer to retirement 
            typically prefer generating income and capital preservation. The more precise you are,the better.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 2:Determine How much you can afford to invest</div>
        <p>
            Pinpointing how much you can afford to put in stocks requires a clear-eyed assessment of your finances. This step 
            helps ensure that you are investing responsibly without endangering your financial stability.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 3:Determine your Tolerance for Risk</div>
        <p>
            Understanding your risk tolerance is a cornerstone of investing. It helps you align your comfort level with the inherent 
            uncertainties of the stock market and financial goals.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 4:Determine your investing Styles</div>
        <p>
            Your investing style is crucial in how you approach stock investments. Whether you prefer a hands-on approach or a more 
            passive strategy, understanding your style helps you choose the right investment methods and tool

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 5:Choose an Investment Account</div>
        <p>
            You've figured out your goals, the risk you can tolerate, and how active an investor you want to be. Now, it's time to 
            choose the type of account you'll use. Each has its own features, benefits, and drawbacks. In addition, the type of account 
            you choose can greatly impact your tax situation, investment options, and overall strategy. You'll need to compare 
            different brokers to find the investment account right for you.
            
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 6:Fund your Stock Account</div>
        <p>
           By this step, you've picked a broker that aligns with your investment goals and preferences or is simply the most convenient.
           You've also decided whether you're opening a cash account, which requires you to pay for investments in full, or a margin 
           account, which lets you borrow when purchasing securities.
        </p>
        <div class="definition-heading">Step 7:Pick Your Stocks</div>
        <p>
            Even experienced investors grapple with choosing the best stocks. Beginners should look for stability, a strong track record,
            and the potential for steady growth. Resist the temptation to gamble on risky stocks, hoping for a quick windfall. Long-term 
            investing is mostly slow and steady, not fast and rash.

        <h3>How to buy Cryptocurrency?</h3>
        <div class="definition-heading">Step 1:Choose a reliable Exchange</div>
        
        <p>
            Select a cryptocurrency exchange where you can buy, sell, and store your cryptocurrencies. Popular exchanges include 
            Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Gemini. Ensure the exchange is reputable and secure.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 2:Create an Account</div>
        <p>
            Sign up for an account on your chosen exchange. This typically involves providing some personal information, verifying 
            your email, and setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 3:Verify yout identity</div>
        <p>
            Most exchanges require identity verification due to regulatory requirements. This process might include uploading a photo 
            ID and possibly a selfie.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 4:Deposit Funds</div>
        <p>
            After your account is verified, deposit funds into your exchange account. You can usually fund your account via bank 
            transfer, credit/debit card, or other payment methods depending on the exchange.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 5:Choose Your Cryptocurrency</div>
        <p>

        <p>
            Once you’ve purchased the cryptocurrency, store it securely. You can keep it on the exchange, but for better security,

        <h3>How to invest in Cryptocurrency?</h3>
        <div class="definition-heading">Step 1:Choose What Cryptocurrency to invest in</div>
        <p>
            In the same way that you’d evaluate the potential risks and financial health of a company before buying its stock, you’ll 
            want to understand and carefully evaluate the different, unique characteristics of each cryptocurrency you’re considering 
            for investment. You may choose to invest in one or several different cryptocurrencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vetting cryptocurrencies can be more difficult because they have become a popular vehicle for fraud, such as pump-and-dump schemes. 
            Those risks might leave you wondering how to invest in cryptocurrency without falling victim to a scam. In order to avoid pump-and-dump 
            schemes, avoid smaller/newer cryptos that are being heavily promoted on social media platforms. It’s critical to analyze the investment 
            risk of a given cryptocurrency and social media experts may not have your best interests in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although you may be able to minimize your exposure to fraud and cybersecurity risk by investing through a large, reputable platform, because 
            the whole industry isn’t regulated, it’s impossible to eliminate this risk. For example, in 2022, we learned FTX, which was formerly considered 
            a reputable platform, was being run by bad actors who misappropriated clients’ funds. On November 2, 2023, its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried was found 
            guilty of fraud and money laundering. And on March 28, 2024, the court sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 2:Select a Cryptocurrency exchange</div>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrency must be bought through an exchange or investment platform, such as Coinbase, Gemini, or Kraken. Some factors you may wish to consider 
            when selecting an exchange are security, fees, the volume of trading, minimum investment requirements, and the types of cryptocurrency available 
            for purchase on a given exchange.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 3:Consider Storage and digital wallet options</div>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrency is completely digital, which means you should have a digital place to keep your coins safe. One choice is to keep them on the same platform 
            where you’re investing. Nowadays, many new cryptocurrency investors prefer this method. Just make sure you pick a platform that will be responsible for 
            custody and safekeeping of your assets. Such platforms are regulated, have strong protection against hackers and online threats, and carry financial insurance.

        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose not to hold your cryptocurrency on the more popular platforms, you’ll need a crypto wallet; these hold the private keys that allow you to access 
            your crypto by unlocking the digital identity that is associated with your ownership, recorded on the blockchain. You can opt for either a “hot” or “cold” 
            digital wallet. A hot wallet is accessible via the internet and is generally more convenient. A cold wallet is a physical storage device, much like a USB 
            drive, that keeps your cryptocurrency keys completely offline and generally more secure. Holding your cryptocurrency in a wallet provides an extra layer of 
            protection.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 4:Decide How much to Invest in</div>
        <p>
            Just like any investment, the amount you choose to put into crypto will depend on many factors, such as your budget, risk tolerance, and investing strategy. 
            You’ll also want to consider any minimum investment requirements and transaction costs, which vary across crypto exchanges.

        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to invest in a cryptocurrency with a high value per coin, most exchanges allow you to invest on a dollar basis, rather than buying a whole coin. 
            This means you don’t need a huge amount of money to invest in something like Bitcoin. Focus on the total amount of money you want to invest, rather than the 
            number of coins you want to buy. And always remember, don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. At Stash, we recommend holding no more than 2% of your 
            overall portfolio in any one crypto in order to limit crypto specific risks.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Step 5:Manage Your Investments</div>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrency is a unique investment because it can be used to buy things and can also be held as a long-term investment; how you manage your crypto holdings 
            depends on your investing strategy and goals. You may wish to consider applying the Stash Way, a philosophy focused on regular investing, diversification, and 
            investing for the long term

            Tax payment refers to the mandatory financial charge imposed by a government on individuals and businesses to fund public services and infrastructure.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Income Tax:</div>
        <p>
            This is typically the most significant tax for individuals and businesses. Individuals pay income tax on their earnings, while businesses pay on their profits. 
            Tax rates and brackets vary depending on the jurisdiction.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Filing Requirements:</div>
        <p>
            Filing Requirements: Taxpayers must file annual tax returns, reporting their income, deductions, and credits. In the U.S., the deadline is usually April 15th.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Deductions and Credits</div>
        <p>
            Deductions and Credits: Tax deductions reduce taxable income, while tax credits reduce the actual tax owed. Common deductions include mortgage interest and charitable 
            donations. Credits might include education credits or renewable energy incentives.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Payment methods</div>

        <div class="definition-heading">What is property Tax?</div>
        <p>
            A property tax is an annual or semiannual charge levied by a local government and paid by the owners of real estate within its jurisdiction. 
            Property tax is an ad-valorem tax, meaning the amount owed is a percentage of the assessed value of the real estate.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Understanding Property Tax</div>
        <p>
            Property tax is paid by individuals or legal entities such as corporations that own the property.It is characterized as a regressive tax. 
            That is, the same rate of taxation is applied regardless of the taxpayer's income. The burden falls disproportionately on lower-income taxpayers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tax is usually based on the value of the owned property, including land and structures. Many jurisdictions also tax tangible personal property, 
            such as cars and boats. Property tax rates and the types of properties taxed vary by jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <div class="definition-heading">Hpw to calculate property Tax?</div>
        <p>
            The amount owners owe in property tax is determined by multiplying the property tax rate by the current market value of the property. Most taxing 
            authorities recalculate the tax rate annually.Almost all property taxes are levied on real property, which is legally defined and classified by the state. 
            Real property generally includes land, structures, and other fixed buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, property owners are subject to the rates determined by the municipal government. The municipality appoints or elects a tax assessor who 
            evaluates local property and calculates property taxes based on current fair market values. This value becomes the assessed value of the home.In almost all 
            local property tax codes, the owner has the right to formally contest the rate assessed. When property taxes are unpaid, the taxing authority may assign a 
            lien against the Property.

        <div class="definition-heading">Calculate Tax on Jobs</div>
        <p>
            Calculating income tax on salary involves a systematic process that considers various components of an individual's earnings and deductions permitted under 
            the tax laws. This comprehensive approach ensures accurate determination of tax liability and facilitates effective tax planning. The process typically 
            comprises five key steps, each playing a crucial role in arriving at the final tax amount.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step involves computing the gross income, which encompasses the entirety of an individual's salary components such as basic pay, allowances (like HRA, LTA), 
            and bonuses. Exemptions applicable to specific components, such as HRA, are subtracted from the gross income, along with the standard deduction available to all employees, 
            currently set at Rs 50,000. This step results in the determination of net salary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, the net taxable income is computed by further reducing the taxable amount through deductions permitted under various sections of the Income Tax Act. These deductions 
            include investments and expenses eligible for tax benefits, such as contributions to schemes like PPF, ELSS, EPF (covered under Section 80C), additional contributions to NPS 
            (under Section 80CCD(1B)), health insurance premiums (under Section 80D), and home loan interest (under Section 24). This step yields the net taxable income, which forms the 
            basis for determining the tax liability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the net taxable income is established, the third step involves determining the tax liability by applying the applicable income tax slabs. These slabs categorize income 
            into different brackets, with each bracket subjected to a specific tax rate. The tax rates are structured progressively, with higher income levels attracting higher tax rates. 
            This computation provides the preliminary tax amount payable by the individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fourth step entails finalizing the tax amount by considering additional factors such as rebates, cess, and surcharge. Rebates under Section 87A may apply if the taxable income 
            falls below a specified threshold. Health and education cess, currently set at 4%, is added to the tax amount to support these sectors. Additionally, surcharge may be applicable to 
            individuals with very high incomes, further adjusting the final tax payable.
        </p>
        <p>
            By following this systematic approach, individuals can accurately calculate their income tax on salary, ensuring compliance with tax regulations while optimizing tax efficiency through 
            legitimate deductions and exemptions. This process not only aids in fulfilling tax obligations but also empowers individuals to make informed financial decisions and plan their tax liabilities 
            effectively.

        <div class="definition-heading">What is Loan?</div>
        <p>
            The term loan refers to a type of credit vehicle in which a sum of money is lent to another party in exchange for future repayment of the value or principal amount. In many cases, 
            the lender also adds interest or finance charges to the principal value, which the borrower must repay in addition to the principal balance.Loans may be for a specific, one-time 
            amount, or they may be available as an open-ended line of credit up to a specified limit. Loans come in many different forms including secured, unsecured, commercial, and personal loans.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Understanding Loan</div>
        <p>
            A loan is a form of debt incurred by an individual or other entity. The lender—usually a corporation, financial institution, or government—advances a sum of money to the borrower. 
            In return, the borrower agrees to a certain set of terms including any finance charges, interest, repayment date, and other conditions.
            

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">The Loan Process</div>
        <p>
            Here's how the loan process works: When someone needs money, they apply for a loan from a bank, corporation, government, or other entity. The borrower may be required 
            to provide specific details such as the reason for the loan, their financial history, Social Security number (SSN), and other information. The lender reviews this 
            information as well as a person's debt-to-income (DTI) ratio to determine if the loan can be paid back.

        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the applicant's creditworthiness, the lender either denies or approves the application. The lender must provide a reason should the loan application be denied. 
            If the application is approved, both parties sign a contract that outlines the details of the agreement. The lender advances the proceeds of the loan, after which the 
            borrower must repay the amount including any additional charges, such as interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The terms of a loan are agreed to by each party before any money or property changes hands or is disbursed. If the lender requires collateral,the lender outlines 
            this in the loan documents. Most loans also have provisions regarding the maximum amount of interest, in addition to other covenants, such as the length of time 
            before repayment is required

        <h3>Types of Loans</h3>
        <div class="definition-heading">Home Loan:</div>
        <p>
            These loans help people to buy a house or property, which acts as the collateral. They usually
            have a tenure of 15 to 30 years, depending on the lender and the borrower’s repayment capacity. The interest
            rate for home loans varies but generally ranges from 8.40% to 15% per annum. The loan-to-value ratio typically
            covers up to 80% to 90% of the cost of the property.
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Gold Loan:</div>
        <p>
            Gold loans allow people to borrow money by pledging gold ornaments or jewellery to the lender as collateral.
            The loan duration can vary from a few days to a few years, depending on the lender and the borrower’s preference. The interest rate for gold loans usually ranges from 8% to 18% per annum.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Vehicle Loan:</div>
        <p>
            Vehicle loans help borrowers finance their dream vehicle like a car, bike or an EV (electric vehicle). Lenders usually offer up to 85% of the car’s ex-showroom price as a loan, and the concerned vehicle works as collateral against the loan. Different vehicles in India qualify for different vehicle loans, such as car loans for new, used, or two-wheeler vehicles like motorcycles or scooters.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Loan:Against Property</div>
        <p>
            Loan Against Property (LAP) is a type of secured loan that allows borrowers to use their property as collateral to raise funds for any financial requirement. The current interest rate for LAP ranges from 8.40% to 12.50% per annum, depending on the loan amount, tenure, credit score, and other factors. Lenders usually offer loan amounts up to 75% of the property’s value.

        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Loan against PF/EPF</div>
        <p>
            This type of loan allows borrowers to use their securities, such as stocks, mutual funds, and insurance policies, as collateral for the loan instead of selling them. Lenders usually sanction up to 65% of the NAV of eligible shares and equity funds and up to 85% of eligible debt funds as a loan. You can use the loan funds for anything but cannot redeem the shares or fund units you pledged until you repay the loan.
            Loan against PF/EPF: A Loan against Provident Fund (PF) allows individuals with a PF account to borrow money against their accumulated PF balance. Because these loans are early withdrawals, you don’t pay any interest. However, you can only withdraw early for specific reasons like medical emergencies, buying a home, weddings, unemployment,etc.
            
        </p>

        <div class="definition-heading">Loan against Fixed Deposit</div>
        <p>
            A loan against FDs is a type of secured loan. You can get it by pledging your fixed deposit (FD) account as collateral. You can usually get a loan up to 90-95% of the FD amount. The loan does not affect your FD interest; you can use it for various purposes. The loan duration is the same as the FD tenure, and the interest rate is slightly higher than the FD rate.
